# Data Mining Problem and Solution
> Our solution may not be the best one because we are still young, dumb, and broke. 

This github is for you guys who interested in data mining as we are.

## Installation
Please refer to one of the following language for data mining:
- Python ( Most recommended )
- R
- Java


## Usage example
1. Make local folder to root
2. Read readme on each problem first.
3. If datasets is not provided, download from readme and put it on your local folder so it won't be pushed ( Datasets too big )
